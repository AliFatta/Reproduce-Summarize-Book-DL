    "## 1️⃣ Chapter Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we tackled **Sentiment Analysis**, which is a classification task (assigning a label to a sequence). In this chapter, we pivot to **Language Modeling**, a generative task. Language modeling is the art of predicting the next word (or character) in a sequence given the history of previous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are the backbone of modern NLP (including models like GPT and BERT). They allow machines to generate text, complete sentences, and understand linguistic structure without explicit grammatical rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Machine Learning Concepts:**\n",
    "* **Language Modeling (LM):** Probabilistic prediction of the next token in a sequence.\n",
    "* **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):** A streamlined variant of LSTMs that is computationally efficient.\n",
    "* **Perplexity:** The standard metric for evaluating language models (measuring model \"surprise\").\n",
    "* **Decoding Strategies:** Greedy Decoding vs. Beam Search for text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Skills:**\n",
    "* Creating advanced `tf.data` pipelines with **sequence bucketing** to handle variable-length text efficiently.\n",
    "* Implementing a custom Keras Metric (`Perplexity`).\n",
    "* Building a text generation inference loop.\n",

    "## 2️⃣ Theoretical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What is Language Modeling?\n",
    "Formally, a language model computes the probability of a word $w_t$ given the preceding words $w_1, w_2, ..., w_{t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(w_t | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{t-1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By maximizing this probability for the correct next word across a massive corpus, the model learns grammar, syntax, and some semantics of the language. This allows it to generate coherent text by recursively predicting the next word and feeding it back as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)\n",
    "While LSTMs are powerful, they are complex (3 gates, 2 states). The **GRU**, introduced by Cho et al. (2014), simplifies this architecture without significantly sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "1.  **Two Gates:** \n",
    "    * *Update Gate ($z_t$):* Decides how much of the past information needs to be passed along to the future.\n",
    "    * *Reset Gate ($r_t$):* Decides how much of the past information to forget.\n",
    "2.  **Single State:** Unlike LSTM which has a Cell State ($c_t$) and Hidden State ($h_t$), GRU merges them into a single hidden state $h_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Evaluation Metric: Perplexity\n",
    "Accuracy is not a good metric for language modeling. If the sentence is \"I went to the...\", both \"park\" and \"store\" are valid. If the model predicts \"park\" but the label is \"store\", accuracy is 0, but the model isn't necessarily \"wrong\" linguistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perplexity (PPL)** measures how \"surprised\" the model is by the true next word. Lower is better.\n",
    "$$ \\text{Perplexity} = e^{\\text{CrossEntropyLoss}} $$\n",
    "* **Low Perplexity:** The model assigns high probability to the true word.\n",
    "* **High Perplexity:** The model assigns low probability to the true word (it is surprised).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Decoding Strategies\n",
    "Once trained, how do we generate text?\n",
    "1.  **Greedy Decoding:** At each step, pick the word with the highest probability. \n",
    "    * *Pros:* Fast.\n",
    "    * *Cons:* Can get stuck in repetitive loops; misses high-probability *sequences* if the first word has low probability.\n",
    "2.  **Beam Search:** Keeps track of the top $K$ (beam width) most probable *sequences* at each step. \n",
    "    * *Pros:* Finds better overall sequences.\n",
    "    * *Cons:* Computationally more expensive."

    "* **Language Modeling:** Defined as predicting $P(w_t | w_{<t})$. It allows for text generation.\n",
    "* **Data Processing:** We used **N-grams** (bigrams) to reduce vocabulary size compared to word-level modeling and handled variable length stories using **Bucketing** in `tf.data`.\n",
    "* **Model:** We used a **GRU**-based architecture. GRUs are efficient RNNs with Update and Reset gates.\n",
    "* **Metrics:** We implemented **Perplexity**, the standard metric for LM, defined as the exponent of the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* **Inference:** We converted the training model into a **Stateful** model for efficient inference, preventing the need to re-process the entire history for every new word prediction."
